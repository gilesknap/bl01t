volumes:
  # hand coded opi files from this repo
  opi:

  # Note - for the moment we don't use this volume but instead bind mount
  # services/opis host folder into the ioc containers.
  #
  # This is because of a podman limitation that ignores the subpath field
  # of a volume mount.
  #
  # Keeping this file as a reminder of how we would prefer to use docker
  # volumes for this purpose once the issue is resolved:
  # https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/20661

  # in kubernetes we also create volumes for
  # - autosave
  # - runtime (mounted to /epics/runtime)
  # - data - for each IOC that wants to persist data
  # - binaries - for proxy that control hard IOCs and supply their binaries
  #
  # in future this compose framework could include these volumes too
