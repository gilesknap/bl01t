OPI Folders for IOCs
====================

If required, hand coded bob files can be added here for each IOC in a subfolder with the same name as the IOC. These folders are copied in to the 'opi' volume by the init_epics container.

PVI autogenerated bob files will then be added to these folders in the opi volume as each IOC launches.
